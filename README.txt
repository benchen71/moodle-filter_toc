Table of Contents (TOC) Filter
2017 version
==============================

The Table of Contents filter scans pages for heading tags (like h1,
h2, etc) and automatically generates a nested list of these tags
as a table of contents. Each entry in the table is made into an
html link to the actual heading.

The plugin has both global and local settings.

GLOBAL SETTINGS
===============
* Headings: you can nominate which headings tags you want the filter
to look for (default: h1,h2,h3,h4)
* Search in divs: you can choose whether or not to look for headings
tags located inside divs (default: yes)
* Backlink: you can choose whether or not to include a backlink at
the end of the heading that links back to the TOC.
* TOC Title: you can nominate the title used in the TOC (default:
Table of Contents)
* TOC Title Heading Tag: you can choose which heading tag is used for
the TOC's title (default: 1)

LOCAL SETTINGS
==============
(The local settings allow you to override the global settings on a
per page basis.)
* Headings: you can nominate which headings tags you want the filter
to look for
* TOC Title: you can nominate the title used in the TOC
* TOC Title Heading Tag: you can choose which heading tag is used for
the TOC's title

HIDING INDIVIDUAL HEADINGS
==========================
You can also hide specific headings from the TOC by wrapping the heading
in a div with class="non-toc".  For example,

<div class="non-toc">
<h1>Lesson 1 â€” Greco-Roman Civilisation</h1>
</div>

LOCATION
========
By default, the location of the TOC is placed at the beginning of the
page. However, you can nominate a different position by putting the string

[contents]

where you want the TOC to appear.

CSS
===
CSS styling may be used to modify the appearance of the table. The entire
table is contained within a div with the 'toc' class. The backlinks have
the class 'toc_link' applied to them.  For example,

/* Hide bullets in TOCs */
.toc ul {
    list-style: none;
}

(Add to the custom CSS field of your moodle theme.)
